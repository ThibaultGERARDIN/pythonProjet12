class Contract(Base):
    """
    ORM model representing a contract between a client and the company.

    A contract is linked to a client and assigned to a sales representative.
    It tracks the total value, remaining balance, signature status, and is related to any events
    organized under its scope.

    Attributes:
        id (int): Primary key, auto-incremented.
        total_amount (float): Total value of the contract in euros.
        to_be_paid (float): Remaining amount to be paid.
        creation_date (datetime): Timestamp of when the contract was created (automatically set).
        last_update (datetime): Timestamp of last update (automatically set on modification).
        is_signed (bool): Indicates whether the contract has been signed.
        client_id (int): Foreign key referencing the associated client (required).
        sales_contact_id (int): Foreign key referencing the responsible sales representative (required).
        client (Client): SQLAlchemy relationship to the associated client.
        sales_contact (User): SQLAlchemy relationship to the sales contact.
        events (List[Event]): Events related to this contract. Deleting the contract removes related events.

    Properties:
        is_fully_paid (bool): Returns True if the remaining amount to be paid is zero.

    Constants:
        HEADERS (Tuple[str]): List of field names used for tabular export.

    Methods:
        to_list(): Returns the contractâ€™s data as a tuple, suitable for tabular display or export.
